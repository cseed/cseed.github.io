      <h1>Notes on Ethernet</h1>
      
      <h2>100BASE-TX</h2>
      
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet#100BASE-TX">100BASE-TX</a>
        is an Ethernet physical layer standard for 100Mb/s over two-pair
        twisted pair Category 5 cables using 8-pin RJ45 connectors.</p>
      
      <p>Pair 2 (yellow/orange), on pins 1 (+, striped) and pin 2 (-,
        solid) is used for transmit.  Pair 3 (green), on pins 3 (+,
        striped) and 6 (-, solid) is used for receive.</p>

      <p>Binary symbols are transmitted on the wire at 125MBd with three
        voltage levels, +1V, 0V and -1V using
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLT-3_encoding">MLT-3</a>.
        A 0 is signaled by staying at the same voltage level, and a 1 is
        signaled by cyclicly transitioning through (-1V, 0V, +1V, 0V) to
        the next voltage level.  This means a series of 1s generate a
        31.5Mhz signal.</p>
      
      <p>A 100MHz binary signal (e.g. packet data) is encoded
        using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4B5B">4B5B</a> as
        a 125Mhz signal for wire transmission.  A nibble is encoding
        as 5 bits with at least two 1 bits present.  This allows the
        receiver to perform clock recovery.  It also introduces
        additional command symbols to signal beginning and end of
        packet.</p>
      
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet
          frame</a> is organized into bytes.  Within bytes, the least
        significant bit is transmitted first.  FIXME: This isn't the
        whole story due to 4B5B encoding.</p>
      
      <p>The Ethernet frame begins with 7 bytes of preamble, 0x55, and
        the start of frame delimiter, 0xd5.  It ends with a 32-bit
        frame check sequence (CRC).  In 100BASE-TX on the line, the
        frame is preceeded by the start-of-stream delimiter J/K and
        followed by the end-of-stream delimiter T/R.</p>

      <p>TODO: Capture J/K on LA.</p>

      <h2>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</h2>

      <p>ARP can be used to look up the Etherent address associated to
        an IP address.  This is necessary because a host on an
        Ethernet network cannot send a packet directly to an IP
        address.</p>

      <p>The host performing the lookup sends a broadcast ARP packet
        with target Ethernet address.  The host with that Ethernet
        address replies with its IP address.  The ARP request and
        reply packets have the following format:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>6-byte Ethernet destination address</li>
        <li>6-byte Ethernet source address</li>
        <li>2-byte frame type 0x0806</li>
        <li>2-byte hardware address type.  1 for Ethernet.</li>
        <li>2-byte protocol address type.  0x0800 for IP.</li>
        <li>1-byte size of hardware address.  6 for Ethernet.</li>
        <li>1-byte size of protocol address.  4 for IP.</li>
        <li>2-byte operation.  1 for ARP request, 2 for ARP reply.</li>
        <li>6-byte sender Ethernet address</li>
        <li>4-byte sender IP address</li>
        <li>6-byte target Ethernet address</li>
        <li>4-byte target IP address</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There is duplicate information, for example, the sender's
        Ethernet address.  For looking up an IP address from an
        Ethernet address, the Ethernet frame is a 14 byte Ethernet
        header plus a 28 byte of ARP request/reply payload.</p>
