      <h2>Verilog</h2>

      <p>There are two types of numbers, sized and unsized.  Sized
        numbers are represented by <tt>size'base-format number</tt>.
        Unsized numbers are written without a size specification, but
        possibly with a base format.  Sized numbers are always
        positive.  The number of bits in an unsized number is
        implementation-dependent but must be at least 32.  Literals
        with high bit x or z are extended with x or z.  _ is allowed
        in a literal except as the first character.</p>

      <p>Data types: nets, registers, vectors, integer, real, time.
        Vectors can be declared [high:low] or [low:high].  The number
        on the left is always the most significant bit.  Values of
        type time are at least 64 bits.  <tt>$time</tt> gets the
        current simulation time.</p>

      <p>Arrays can have type reg, vector reg, integer or time.
        Multi-dimensional arrays are not supported.  An array of reg
        and a vector reg are not the same.  Memories are arrays of
        registers.</p>

      <p>When a real is assigned to an integer, it is rounded to the
        nearest integer.</p>

      <p>Strings can be stored in registers.  Each character takes up
        8 bits.  Concatenation can be used on
        strings.  <tt>$sformat</tt></p>

      <p>parameters</p>
      
      <p>Concatenation can be used on the right-hand side of continuous
        assignment statements.</p>

      <h3>Behavioral Modeling</h3>

      <p><tt>always</tt> and <tt>initial</tt> are structured
        statements that represent a concurrent activity.
        An <tt>initial</tt> block executes once at time
        0.  <tt>always</tt> block starts at time 0 and executes in a
        loop.  If a statement is prefixed by <tt>#delay</tt>, its
        execution is delayed by <tt>delay</tt> units after the current
        execution time.</p>
      
      <p>The right hand side of an assignment can be one of: a reg (or
        vector reg), integer, real, time, bit select, part select, or
        a concatenation of any of the above.  There are two kinds of
        assignment: blocking and nonblocking.  Blocking assignments
        are written with <tt>=</tt> and evaluate the right-hand side
        and immediately assign the left-hand side.</p>

      <p>Non-blocking assignments are written with <tt>&lt;=</tt> and
        the right-hand side is evaluated and the assignment executes
        at the end of the time step in which it is scheduled.</p>

      <p>There are two kinds of timing controls: delay based and event
        based.  There are three kinds of delay-based controls on
        assignments: regular, intra-assignment and zero delay.
        Event-based controls are specified with <tt>@</tt>.  An event
        is a change on the value of a register or net.  There are four
        types of event-based timing control: regular, named, OR, and
        level-sensitive.  Level-sensitive timing control is written
        using the keyword <tt>wait</tt>.</p>
      
      <p>case statement.  The case value is compared to the
        alternatives in the order they are written.  The comparison is
        done using case equality (<tt>===</tt>).</p>
